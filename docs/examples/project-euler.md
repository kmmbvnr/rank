# Project Euler examples

Project Euler stress-tests Rank's numerical, sequence and array semantics.

## 1. Multiples of 3 or 5

```rank
rem Project Euler 1
rem Multiples of 3 or 5
rem https://projecteuler.net/problem=1

N = 1 until 1000

Mask = N multiple by 3
Mask or= N multiple by 5

Answer = N Mask sum

Answer print
```

This example demonstrates:
- the ordinary/lazy sequence `1 until 1000`;
- the `multiple by` divisibility operation from `numbers`;
- boolean masks as first-class values;
- incremental mask composition with `or=`;
- boolean addressing;
- the `sum` reduction.

This example intentionally uses mask composition rather than the table-oriented
source clause syntax.

## 2. Even Fibonacci numbers

```rank
rem Project Euler 2
rem Sum even Fibonacci terms <= 4e6
rem https://projecteuler.net/problem=2

use sequences
use numbers

Fib = fibonacci to 4000000
Answer = Fib even sum
```

The bounded Fibonacci source stays lazy. The source-bound mask made by `even`
also acts as the selected sequence, so `sum` can consume it directly. The
planner pushes the predicate into the Fibonacci source, which can generate only
even terms.

## 3. Largest prime factor

```rank
rem Project Euler 3
rem Largest prime factor of 600851475143
rem https://projecteuler.net/problem=3

use numbers

Factors = 600851475143 factors
Answer = Factors max
```

`factors` produces a finite lazy sequence of prime factors. The general `max`
reduction consumes it without adding a puzzle-specific operation.

## 4. Largest palindrome product

```rank
rem Project Euler 4
rem Largest product of two N-digit numbers
rem https://projecteuler.net/problem=4

Lower = 10 ** (Digits - 1)
Upper = Lower * 10 - 1

Factors = Lower to Upper
Products = Factors Factors * outer
Mask = Products palindrome rank 0
Answer = Products Mask max
```

`outer` constructs the multiplication table lazily. Ranked `palindrome` checks
each scalar product, and its boolean tensor selects the candidates for `max`.
The helper converts each number to text and compares it with `reverse`.

## 5. Smallest multiple

```rank
rem Project Euler 5
rem Smallest number divisible by 1..20
rem https://projecteuler.net/problem=5

use ranges
use numbers

Range = 1 to 20
Answer = Range lcm
```

The standard `lcm` reduction consumes the lazy range. For `1 to 10`, the same
program produces `2520`.

## 6. Sum square difference

```rank
rem Project Euler 6
rem https://projecteuler.net/problem=6

use ranges
use numbers

Range = 1 to 100
SquareOfSum = (Range sum) ** 2
Squares = Range ** 2
SumOfSquares = Squares sum
Answer = SquareOfSum - SumOfSquares
```

Scalar extension applies `** 2` to every range value, while the parentheses
make the first power operate on the reduced sum. With an upper boundary of
`10`, the result is `2640`.

## 7. 10001st prime

```rank
rem Project Euler 7
rem https://projecteuler.net/problem=7

use sequences

option Count integer = 10001

Index = Count - 1
Answer = primes Index
```

`Count` is one-based because that is how the task states the position. Rank
sequence addressing is zero-based, so the program names the conversion before
addressing the lazy `primes` source. With `Count = 6`, the result is `13`.

## 8. Largest product in a series

```rank
rem Project Euler 8
rem https://projecteuler.net/problem=8

use text
use sequences
use numbers

option Width integer = 13

Digits = Number integer rank 0
Windows = Digits Width window
Products = Windows * reduce rank 1
Answer = Products max
```

Explicit `rank 0` converts the text atoms into a lazy digit sequence. The loops
are unnecessary: `window` exposes each adjacent rank-1 digit cell and the
ranked multiplication reduction produces one value per cell. The default width
13 produces `23514624000`; width 4 produces `5832`.

## 9. Special Pythagorean triplet

```rank
rem Project Euler 9
rem https://projecteuler.net/problem=9

use ranges
use numbers

option Target integer = 1000

ALast = (Target - 1) // 3
BLast = (Target - 1) // 2
A = (1 to ALast) array
B = (2 to BLast) array
PairSums = A B + outer
C = Target - PairSums

Increasing = A B less outer
Increasing and= B less C

ASquares = A ** 2
BSquares = B ** 2
SquareSums = ASquares BSquares + outer
Valid = SquareSums equal C ** 2
Valid and= Increasing

PairProducts = A B * outer
Products = PairProducts * C
Candidates = Products Valid
Answer = Candidates max
```

The bounds follow from `a < Target / 3` and `b < Target / 2`. The `outer`
operations form pairwise sums and squared sums only inside that search space.
Trailing-axis broadcasting compares every `b` with the corresponding `c`, and
the combined boolean tensor keeps only increasing Pythagorean triples. The
default target produces `31875000`; target 12 produces `60`.

## 10. Summation of primes

```rank
rem Project Euler 10
rem https://projecteuler.net/problem=10

use sequences
use numbers

option Limit integer = 2000000

Primes = primes until Limit
Answer = Primes sum
```

The bound becomes part of the lazy prime-source plan, and `sum` consumes that
finite plan. The default limit produces `142913828922`; limit 10 produces `17`.
