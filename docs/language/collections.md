# Collections

`use algo` provides standard local structures with implicit naming.

## Implicit local structure

If a function uses only one instance of a standard structure, the type word
itself denotes that lazily-created local instance.

### Index

`index` is a sparse keyed structure.

```rank
index Ai = i
```

Read:

```rank
j = index Need
```

Membership:

```rank
if Need in index
  ...
end
```

Default:

```rank
Last = index C pad -1
```

Multi-dimensional keyed addressing:

```rank
index A B C = Value
X = index A B C
```

The complete tuple is the key, so an `index` can represent a sparse matrix or
higher-dimensional tensor. It does not infer rectangular dimensions or carry a
dense shape; programs keep those dimensions separately when needed. The key
and value types are inferred from uses within the function.

### Queue

```rank
queue push X
return queue
```

The first use of `queue` lazily creates one queue in the current function-call
workspace. Separate and recursive calls receive separate queues. The queue is
ordered, zero-based, iterable and addressable after it is returned.
For elementwise operations, a queue behaves as a rank-1 array. This lets a
function return a queue and a test compare it directly with an array literal.

`push` takes one argument, so the rest of its line is one complete expression:

```rank
queue push A i + Carry
```

Structure methods place the receiver first and the method second. A method with
no arguments ends after its name; a method with one argument consumes the rest
of the line. The block syntax for methods with two or more arguments is not yet
settled. The earlier `with ... end` proposal is disputed and is not current
syntax.

Addressed mutation uses assignment rather than a `put` method:

```rank
index Row Column = Value
A Row Column = Value
```

An `index` writes a sparse tuple key. An array write requires one in-bounds
index per dense axis and changes the existing material array.

### Set

```rank
set add X
if X in set
  ...
end
Count = set len
```

The first use of `set` lazily creates one set in the current function-call
workspace. `add` is idempotent: adding an equal value again leaves the set
unchanged. Scalars and arrays can be elements; array identity includes both
shape and contents. `in` tests membership, and `len` returns the number of
unique elements.

As with `queue`, separate and recursive function calls receive separate sets.
A set is iterable in insertion order. Adding an existing value does not move
it. An array is useful for a composite value such as a coordinate:

```rank
set add array X Y
```

### Permutations

`permutations` has intrinsic rank 1. It accepts text or a finite rank-1 array,
queue, set or sequence. Text produces a lazy sequence of texts; other inputs
produce a lazy sequence of rank-1 arrays:

```rank
for Route in Cities permutations
  Route visit
end
```

The empty collection has one empty permutation. Input order determines
generation order; sets use insertion order. Results are distinct by value:
equal input values never produce duplicate permutations. The exact sequence
size is the multinomial count, so `len` does not need to enumerate it. An
unbounded sequence is an error.

### Combinations

`combinations` accepts a finite collection and a nonnegative count, then
returns a lazy sequence of selections without repetition:

```rank
for Pair in Values 2 combinations
  Pair score
end
```

Selections follow input order. A count greater than the collection length
produces an empty sequence; count zero produces one empty selection. Equal
values at different positions remain distinct choices. An unbounded sequence
is an error.

For a tensor, `combinations` selects cells along the leading axis and preserves
the remaining cell shape. Given `Rings` with shape `6 3`, every value from
`Rings 2 combinations` therefore has shape `2 3`.

### Counter

`counter` is a frequency map:

```rank
counter add X
Count = counter X
Kinds = counter len
```

The first use lazily creates one counter in the current function-call workspace.
`add` increments the frequency by one. Addressing an absent key returns zero,
and `len` returns the number of distinct keys. Scalar and array keys use the
same equality as `set` elements. Separate and recursive calls receive separate
counters. `counter` is a first-class value with runtime type `.counter`.

Counter iteration and direct frequency assignment are not defined yet.

If multiple structures of the same type are needed, they should be given
explicit names.

## Design rule

These are general data structures, not puzzle-specific shortcuts. Advanced
structures may live in modules:

- heaps;
- disjoint-set union;
- Fenwick tree;
- segment tree;
- bitset;
- sparse table;
- graph structures.
