# Standard library

Rank starts with a small core. Vocabulary is introduced through `use` modules.

Current module directions:

```rank
use numbers
use ranges
use collections
use graph
use tables
use stats
use text
use crypto
use dates
use io
use ml
use algo
use sequences
```

These names are organizational and may still be consolidated.

Each module owns its vocabulary, semantic handlers, validators and execution
planner rules. Common operations normally fit the stable application grammar
and do not add parser productions. Syntax extensions are combined before parser
construction and are then enabled semantically by the corresponding `use`.

## Numbers

Candidate reusable operations:

```rank
odd
even
prime
gcd
lcm
factors
multiple by
min
max
infinity
```

`multiple by` is an elementwise divisibility test and returns a boolean value
or mask:

```rank
Mask = N multiple by 3
```

It is the readable shortcut for `N % 3 equal 0`.

`factors` accepts a positive integer and returns its prime factors as a finite
lazy sequence in ascending order, including repeated factors:

```rank
Factors = 12 factors
rem 2 2 3
```

Factoring zero or a negative integer is an error. Factoring one produces an
empty sequence.

`gcd` and `lcm` use data-first application:

```rank
G = 54 24 gcd
L = 8 12 lcm
```

`lcm` also acts as a named reduction over a finite sequence:

```rank
Answer = (1 to 20) lcm
```

Both operations return nonnegative integers. `0 0 gcd` is zero, an `lcm`
containing zero is zero, and the `lcm` of an empty sequence is one.

`min` and `max` use data-first application. With one collection they reduce it;
with two numeric values they return the smaller or larger operand:

```rank
Smallest = Values min
Left = A B max
```

`infinity` is the positive infinite `real` value. Unary negation produces
`-infinity`.

## Sequences

Examples:

```rank
primes
fibonacci
len
window
```

Both are infinite lazy sources until bounded. `primes` yields ascending prime
integers beginning with `2`, supports `to` and `until`, and may seek to a
zero-based position through normal sequence addressing:

```rank
BelowTwenty = primes until 20
SixthPrime = primes 5
```

## Tables

Includes concepts such as:

```rank
csv
group
join
labels
```

## Stats

Examples:

```rank
mean
median
```

## Text

Examples:

```rank
split
reverse
text
integer
startswith
hex
```

`+` concatenates two text values. Both operands must already be text; Rank does
not implicitly convert numbers or other values:

```rank
Candidate = Secret + N text
```

`split` separates text at every exact occurrence of a text separator and
returns a rank-1 array of text values. Adjacent separators preserve empty
parts. An empty separator splits by Unicode code point:

```rank
Parts = "2x3x4" "x" split
Characters = "A😀Б" "" split
```

`startswith` tests an exact, case-sensitive prefix:

```rank
Ready = Text "Rank" startswith
```

`hex` converts `bytes` to lowercase hexadecimal text without a prefix:

```rank
Encoded = Bytes hex
```

`integer` parses optional `+` or `-` followed by decimal digits. Its intrinsic
unary rank is 1, so a complete text value is converted at once. Explicit
`rank 0` converts each Unicode character and produces a lazy sequence:

```rank
Value = "-1203" integer
Digits = "1203" integer rank 0
```

`text` formats one scalar value as text. Text input is returned unchanged.
Arrays and other collections require an explicit mapping rank rather than
being flattened implicitly.

`reverse` reverses text by Unicode code point:

```rank
Back = "A😀Б" reverse
rem Б😀A
```

Reversal of array axes is a separate tensor operation and remains deferred.

`len` from `sequences` returns the number of Unicode code points in text, the
leading-axis length of an array, the size of a queue or set, or the length of a
finite sequence. It rejects an infinite sequence.

`window` returns overlapping fixed-size cells lazily:

```rank
Pairs = Text 2 window
Windows = Values Width window
WindowShape = array 2 3
Blocks = M WindowShape window
Columns = M 3 window axis 1
```

Tensor window sizes correspond to all axes unless `axis` selects a subset.
Only complete windows are produced.

## Cryptography

`use crypto` provides hash and related byte operations. `md5` hashes the UTF-8
encoding of text and returns 16 `bytes`; formatting remains an explicit step:

```rank
Digest = Text md5
Hash = Digest hex
```

## File I/O

`use io` provides one-shot UTF-8 text operations for the common case:

```rank
Text = Path read
Lines = Path readlines

Text Path write
Text Path append
```

`read` preserves the complete decoded text, including a final line ending.
Invalid UTF-8 raises `.InvalidEncoding`. `readlines` recognizes LF, CRLF and CR,
removes the line separators and does not add an empty item for a final line
ending. An empty file produces an empty rank-1 array.

`write` creates or replaces a file. `append` creates a missing file or adds text
to the end of an existing file. Both encode text as UTF-8.

Random access uses byte offsets. A one-shot block read does not create a visible
file handle:

```rank
Bytes = Path Offset Count readbytes
```

`bytes` is a specialized rank-1 tensor whose atoms are integers from 0 through
255. It formats as hexadecimal text such as `0x52616e6b`. Offsets and counts are
nonnegative integers, and a block ending past the file returns the available
bytes.

Repeated and stateful I/O uses a `file` value:

```rank
File = Path open

Header = File 64 readbytes
File 1024 seek
Chunk = File 128 readbytes

Offset = File position
Length = File size
Done = File eof
```

`seek` sets an absolute byte offset from the beginning. `position` and `size`
return byte counts. `eof` is true when the current position is at or beyond the
current size.

`open` is read-only by default. A mode label selects another mode:

```rank
Output = Path .write open
Update = Path .update open
Log = Path .append open
```

`.write` creates or clears a file, `.update` opens an existing file for reading
and writing, and `.append` creates a missing file and forces writes to its end.
Handles opened by all three modes can be read. Binary output takes a `bytes`
value previously obtained from `readbytes`:

```rank
Output Bytes writebytes
Output flush
```

`flush` requests that buffered output reach the host file system. File-system
failures raise `.IO` and carry the path as `.Value`.

A file is a scoped resource. It closes automatically when its owning function,
test or program exits, including through `return` or an error. Returning a file,
directly or inside a returned collection, moves ownership to the caller. A file
may be closed early with `File close`; closing an already closed file has no
effect, and other operations on it raise `.IO`.

The interpreter accesses files only through its host adapter. The command-line
host uses the local file system; browser and embedded hosts may provide a file
picker, virtual file system or another implementation with the same semantics.

## Dates

Examples:

```rank
hour
weekday
month
year
```

## Algorithm profile

`use algo` may act as a contest-oriented umbrella module rather than introducing
new semantics.

## Rule for adding library vocabulary

A word belongs in the standard library when it represents a broad, reusable
concept with established meaning.

Do not add a word merely because it makes one LeetCode, Euler or Kaggle task
shorter.
